## 1. Research Topic
We aim to analyze patterns in online poker player behavior using real transaction and gameplay data.
Our study will examine relationships between player demographics, betting patterns, and financial outcomes to understand
different player types and their gambling strategies.

## 2. Data Source
Source: The Transparency Project (www.thetransparencyproject.org)  
Provider: Division on Addiction, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard Medical School  
Dataset: "Second Session at the Virtual Poker Table"  
Reference: Tom, M. A., et al. (2022). Second Session at the Virtual Poker Table:
A Contemporary Study of Actual Online Poker Activity. Journal of Gambling Studies. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10899-022-10147-1  
Sample: 5,028 online poker players who registered in February 2015

## 3. Data Description
The dataset consists of five interconnected CSV files:
- Demographics (5,028 players): Age, Gender, Country of residence
- Cash Games (51,763 daily records): Stakes wagered, winnings, number of sessions
- Tournaments (82,831 daily records): Entry fees, prizes, number of tournaments
- Deposits (295,119 transactions): Amount, payment method, transaction status
- Withdrawals (32,307 transactions): Amount, payment method, transaction status

Key variables include player demographics, daily gambling activity (stakes and winnings),
and financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals in Euros).

## 4. Preliminary Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1 (Linear Regression)
There is a positive linear relationship between the total amount a player deposits and the total amount they withdraw.
We expect that players who invest more money into their accounts will also cash out larger amounts,
indicating either successful play or cycling of funds. We will use linear regression analysis to test this relationship
and calculate the correlation coefficient.

### Hypothesis 2 (Logistic Regression/Classification)
Player demographic characteristics (age and gender) can predict whether a player primarily engages in cash games versus
tournaments. We hypothesize that younger players and male players are more likely to prefer cash games over tournaments.
We will develop a logistic regression model, train it on 70% of the data, and test its classification accuracy on the remaining
30%.

## 5. Initial Insights
Preliminary exploration reveals that only 1,827 of 5,008 players (36%) made withdrawals, suggesting many players experience 
net losses. The dataset shows distinct player groups: 4,232 played cash games and 3,448 played tournaments, with some overlap.
The rich temporal structure allows for analysis of betting patterns over time, and multiple grouping variables enable comparative
statistical tests between different player segments.
